## Predict-tags-on-StackOverflow with linear models

In this project, we predict tags for posts from StackOverflow. To solve this task you will use the multilabel classification approach. We consider two different approaches for the text classification - 
1.) In the first approach we train with Bag of words on 5000 frequent words from the corpus. 
2.) In the second approach, we train with sklearn's TfidfVectorizer()

Libraries used: numpy, pandas, sklearn, nltk
